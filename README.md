# K-means Clustering on HiperCropDataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates the application of the K-means clustering algorithm on the **HiperCropDataset**. The aim is to explore and uncover underlying patterns in the dataset using unsupervised machine learning techniques. The notebook provides a step-by-step approach, including data preprocessing, feature selection, and clustering evaluation.

## Project Description
- **Dataset:** The HiperCropDataset (assumed to contain relevant data such as images or tabular data on crop fields) is analyzed to identify clusters based on inherent similarities.
- **Methodology:**  
  - **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
  - **K-means Clustering:** Apply the K-means algorithm to segment the data into distinct groups.
  - **Analysis:** Evaluate and interpret the clusters to draw meaningful insights.
- **Objective:**  
  - To demonstrate the process of implementing a popular unsupervised learning algorithm.
  - To provide insights into the natural groupings within the dataset, which could be useful for further analysis or decision-making in agricultural contexts.
